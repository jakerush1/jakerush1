Hello, I'm Jake. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in Pittsburgh. I specialize in building scalable web applications and integrating AI technologies, with 7 years of experience in delivering high-quality solutions.

I'm currently at [Eventbrite ðŸŽŸ](https://eventbrite.com) where I focus on building scalable solutions while maintaining strong user experience.

Previously, I worked at [ToneDen](https://toneden.io) as an Ad Operations Engineer where I helped design and build a marketing automation platform, and co-invented a patented system to predict & optimize various attributes of digital marketing campaigns.
